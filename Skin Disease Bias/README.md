Building a deep learning classifier to identify skin tone in skin disease datasets to diagnose bias towards lighter skin tones in unlabeled datasets. 

Architecture uses two branches to seperately process colour and lightness of images, as well as inception blocks to process images at different scales. 

Approach improves upon previously published methods for this task.
