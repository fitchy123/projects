Training a bipedal walker (OpenAI Gym) to walk using deep reinforcement learning. Algorithm is adapted from TD3-FORK which is an extension of TD3. Robot learns to walk in about 250 episodes (up to 1000 steps per episode). By just altering the reward structure of the environment the algorithm can also train the walker on the hardcore environment as shown in the video.
